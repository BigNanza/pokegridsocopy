        <h2>How to play</h2>
        <p>
          This game is heavily inspired from
          <a href="https://www.pokedoku.com/" target="_blank">PokeDoku</a>
          and it functions almost the same. You have to fill in a pokemon that
          fits the categories indicated by the row and column headers.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there is one <strong>major</strong> twist. The goal of the
          game is to get the pokemon that has the
          <strong>highest value</strong> in a specific stat. For example, in
          PokeFatso, you have to get the pokemon with the highest weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          More info on each of the categories and win conditions can be found on
          the
          <a href="gamechooser.html">game chooser</a> page. To see all the
          pokemon that fit a category check the
          <a href="pokemonlist.html">pokemon list</a> page.

      <div class="aboutsite">
        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <p>
          As mentioned previously, I took a lot of inspiration from PokeDoku and
          you should definitely check them out.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to expand the original PokeDoku game and add more categories
          and win conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the data taken from this site is from the
          <a href="https://pokeapi.co" target="_blank">RESTful Pokemon API</a>
          so a big thanks to them. The data from the api is not perfect so if
          there are any errors please reach out to me.
